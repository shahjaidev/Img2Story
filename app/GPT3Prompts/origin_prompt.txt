Here is an award winning short story:
[[Prompt]]:A woman paddling on a surfboard. 
[[Story]]:Maria sat on her surfboard, as it bobbed up and down on the coastal waves. The neon lights of Ocean Drive burned on the shore in the distance, like green and pink embers. It was just her, the water, and whatever starlight got past the Miami light pollution.

[[Prompt]]:A shark swimming in the ocean.
[[Story]]:She was paddling back to shore when she saw a shark fin in the water. At first she thought it was a manatee or a dolphin. She’d occasionally seen those swimming around here, spent countless hours watching them under the night sky. But this was different.

[[Prompt]]:A boat in the lake.
[[Story]]:A bright spotlight shown down on Maria. Maria looked up, and saw a small fishing boat, floating half-way between her and the shoreline. A stout man in an orange rain coat and fishing boots stood on the deck. “Get out of the water!” A gruff voice shouted. Maria's eyes went wide. She turned and saw the large dorsal fin rapidly advancing. The shark’s body hovered just under the surface like a dark cloud. Maria’s hands dove into the water, paddling faster than she’d ever paddled in her life. Her legs kicked frantically. 


Here is an award winning short story:
[[Prompt]]:A car on the road.
[[Story]]:The rain was falling heavily and Jason eased off the accelerator a little. Had to be careful driving on wild nights like these. The last thing Jason wanted was to have an accident or breakdown. The thwack-thwack of the windscreen wipers was hypnotic. He stared out into the glow of the headlights. The rain sounded like white noise interference as it battered the car. He was reminded of the opening scenes of a Hitchcock film.

[[Prompt]]:A man on walking on the street.
[[Story]]:Through the wash of the rain he spotted a man walking at the side of the road. The person wore a green parka and had their thumb jerked out.
Why on earth would anyone be hitchhiking tonight? Surely you would just stay put until the morning. They must have been in a rush to get where they were going. He signalled down and pulled over. The hitchhiker climbed in. He shut the door quickly, glad to be out of the rain. He pulled his hood back and sighed. He was somewhere in his mid-twenties and had wild red hair and a thick beard. They drove on in silence for a short while.
