Here is an award winning short story:
[[Prompt]]:a fire truck parked in a parking lot.
[[Story]]:It was a slow, windy night for the firefighters in the Valley. Once the sun went down, it was pretty quiet. They'd been called out to a gas leak once and an armed robbery, but nothing to keep them busy. They were getting ready to turn in for the night.They were parked on the edge of a large, empty parking lot not far from the station.The engine was silent and the flashing lights were off. All the men in the truck were in deep and well deserved sleep. A deep, roaring sound shook them from their dreams. They were momentarily stunned. No one moved. The sound was so loud it rattled the truck. Then the moment passed, and they knew what it was. It was a tornado.A terrible twister was ripping through the town.They sprang to their feet and scrambled to get their equipment on. They still had to warn the people of the town. They had to do their duty.
